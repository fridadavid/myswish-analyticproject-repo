##########KUBERNETES  PROJECT ###########
1.
Today there are serveral options of providing multiple develpoment environments in K8s for employees depending on the organization needs and infrastrucure.

Based on the basic needs of Swish analytics I will suggest  the following  tools:

 a. Rancher: it comes with a good management UI to manage multiple clusters
                   -Employees can easily deploy multiple managed clusters from EKS, GKE
                   -Import existing clusters
                   -Enforce security across clusters
b. Jenkins: automate CI/CD pipeline
                 -to create a pipeline for building and deploying in different development environments

c. dockerHub: to store all images we create to deploy applictions.
                     - use official base  images to  in our dockerfiles to build our app images
                     -we can easily scan our images for vulnerabilty before deploying
d. Helm: use as package manager to delpoy third party tools in our k8s 
              cluster

e. Docker: to build images and push to dockerHub

To monitor my EKS Cluster in different environments, we can use tools like Prometheus and Grafana and New Relic.

In one of my previous jobs i made use of New Relic to monitor our EKS clusters in different environments.
Please permit me if i talk more on New Relic because is a monitoring tool that i have actually used. 

2a.
In this case i will use New Relic to Monitor my EKS clusters
I integrate nr with all my AWS accounts having EKS clusters
I used guided install in my nr account to easily install nr in my EKS clusters with relative ease making use of helm
Immidiately nr starts monitoring the clusters


2c.
Notify when resources are underutilized

In nr I write queries using NRQL  and create dashboards to monitor resources like:
     -resource cpu used core
     -memory working set bytes
     -container cpu usage
     -container memory usage
From the above metrics i will be able to see on my dashboards if resources are underutilsed.
I will create alert policies, define conditions that is set notification thresholds and assign to one or more notification channels like slack, emails to get notifcations when resources are underutilsed
